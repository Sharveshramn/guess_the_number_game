 ðŸŽ² Number Guessing Game in Python

A beginner-friendly Python terminal game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of chances. The number of chances is based on the binary search principle using `log2(range)` for an optimal challenge.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The player is prompted to start or wait.
2. They enter the upper and lower bounds of the number range.
3. The game randomly picks a number in that range.
4. The player has limited chances to guess the number, calculated using `math.log2(range)`.
5. After each guess, hints are provided.
6. A warning is shown before the last chance.
7. Victory or defeat messages are displayed accordingly.
